    As a Data Scientist, I specialized in solving challenges within Human Resources by leveraging data-driven insights to enhance processes, strategies, and decision-making.
    <br><br>
    My work involved analyzing and testing hypotheses to validate HR strategies, fine-tuning and integrating large language models (LLMs) to develop tools for 
    interpreting vast amounts of text data, such as surveys and reviews. Additionally, I used machine learning to generate predictive analytics, empowering HR and people leaders with data-backed insights to make informed decisions.
