        As cloud solutions gain popularity and machine learning models and data grow larger, more and more companies are using cloud solutions to train and deploy there models, and with that the question of security comes along.
        <br>
        <br>
        Basic encryption algorithms solves problems for databases where we don't need to do operations on the encrypted data but in machine learning we need to use fully homomorphic encryption which lets us operate on encrypted data.
        <br>

        In this project I built starting from basic operations like or, and building up to addition, substraction to log, exponential operators and then building logistic regression and a CNN model using these methods. The results can be seen with the google drive link above.
