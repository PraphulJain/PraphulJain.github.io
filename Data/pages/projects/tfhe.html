        As cloud solutions gain popularity and machine learning models and data grow larger, more and more companies are using cloud solutions to train and deploy there models, which raises the question of how secure is our data which will be processed out of the companies network.
        <br>
        <br>
        Basic encryption algorithms solves problems for databases where we don't need to do operations on the encrypted data but in machine learning we need to use fully homomorphic encryption which lets us operate on encrypted data.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this project I built starting from basic operations like 'or', 'and' building up to addition, substraction to log, exponential operators and then building logistic regression and a CNN model using these methods. The results can be seen with the google icon above.
        <br>
        <br>
        All this was built up in fully homomorphic domain which means the model and the data remains encrypted even when the model is being trained and all the operations are taking place. This method is very slow relative to anyways slow training of ML models these days but show a promising solution to the security issues of machine learning with cloud solutions.
