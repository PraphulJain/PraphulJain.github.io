        Mirage is a 2D spatial reasoning platformer I designed and developed with the aims of demonstrating usage of the spatial reasoning core dynamic whilst maintaining structured and fluid tutorialization of a prototype game during a 2 week sprint.
        <br>
        <br>
        The game forces players to experience the world of platforming outside the boundaries of the norm, it does so by providing the player an experience where they must demonstrate deductive and spatial reasoning simultaneously, but with a unique twist!
