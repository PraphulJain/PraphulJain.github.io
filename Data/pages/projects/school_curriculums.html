        As the world keeps on changing, the school curriculums also must evolve to keep up the education quality, therefore, in this project we were tasked with comparing different curriculums based on there contents and the results of students in the exams.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a part of this we used image processing (tesseract OCR) to extract text from pdf versions of school textbooks, which was then processed and transformed into knowledge graph which was used to compare the topics and to what depths are they covered in different curriculums.
        <br>
        <br>
        This project not only encouraged us to search the current best available solutions, it also made us to present and report the results in a systematic way.
